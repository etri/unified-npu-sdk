Unified SDK
===========

A unified SDK designed to simplify model compilation and runtime execution
across heterogeneous AI accelerators (NPUs).

Structure:
 - build:     Model compilation modules
 - runtime:   Runtime creation and inference modules
 - backends:  Backend adapters (TensorRT, Rebellions, Furiosa, etc.)
 - frontends: Model import and conversion (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, etc.)
